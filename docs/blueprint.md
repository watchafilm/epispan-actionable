## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant light blue (#7BBAFF) to suggest calm but ensure readability against a white background.
- Background color: A very light desaturated blue (#F2F8FF), subtly hinting at the primary color, but close to white.
- Accent color: A bright yellow (#FFE666) for interactive elements, such as the 'Click -> Gait Speed' button as seen in the original image. The accent color is approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of the primary color's hue in HSL space; it contrasts well in both saturation and brightness against the primary color, making it very visually salient for improved usability.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look, ensuring readability across all sections.
- Cell-like structure for displaying individual data points, mimicking the original spreadsheet layout for familiarity.
- Clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the information within each cell, using appropriate headings and spacing.
